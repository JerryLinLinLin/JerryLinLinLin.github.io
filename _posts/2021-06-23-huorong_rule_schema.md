## Intro

[Huorong Internet Security](https://www.huorong.cn/) is known for allowing users to create their own HIPS rules against malware infections, but editing through GUI is not efficient when there are many rules with same templates. Here I create JSON schema of rule files for error checking and auto-completion.

## Usage

- **`rule_schema.json`** - schema for main rule JSON

- **`auto_schema.json`** - schema for verdict cache JSON
